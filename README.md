# 1) Synopsis
Welcome to this small guide, hopefully you find it useful!

**Genso Suikoden Card Stories** is a pretty niche spin-off game, the story is a retelling of Suikoden II with some changes here and there. So if you didn't play Suikoden II on PS1, I strongly recommend that you do that first. The story is mostly in Visual Novel ADV format, you can move around the world map from town to town outside of that or inside dungeons. The gameplay revolves around collecting cards, building your deck and win the fights by using cards that represent "Missions" and then playing character cards to win those missions which will earn you points and then win the fight once you reach the requirement number.

# 2) Overview
If you never played this game, especially if you're not familiar with card games, I recommend to just play the game casually on your first run at your own pace. There's a New Game+ feature, so you can tackle whatever you need and continue your card collection afterwards. Some challenges might be rough on your first run if you don't have a good deck for it. It's impossible to finish the game in 1 playthrough, mainly due to [Link]"The Mad Prince" achievement.

You can tackle this set however you want, obligatory progression achievements are the only ones blocked for NG+.

# 3) Walkthrough

[**Step 1: Dummy Step**](#step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999)

Here you can give a detailed explanation about every step, such as what the achievements are about, if there are any missables in this step, general tips to make sure every achievement is gotten in one run etc.

To make this header link to the section with these achievements, go to where the step is and hover over the header. A link icon should be visible on the left of the header, which you can right-click + copy and then paste where #step-1-dummy-step--total-points-999 currently is. Remove everything of the link before "step".

You can create as many steps as you desire. Recommended is to have one step dedicated to unmissable story achievements, while the others cover game-specific steps (like no-damage bosses, item collection etc.)

If the step has missables, be sure to make a bulletpoint list like below to inform the reader right away.
